# thinking-in-a-recursive-way
hi guys! i heard that people learning haskell are coooooooooooooooooooooool people, i want to be coooooooooooooooooooooool(oh shit...how many 'o' did i type??) so im learning haskell now. 
well... seriously, i find recursion quite graceful in solving problems, learning haskell is a great way to improve recursive thinking.
i'll push some recursive functions to this repo, hope u like it :-)
大家好，这个repo的初衷是通过学习haskell锻炼递归思考问题的能力。
